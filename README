== Operation ==

Usage: pwcheck [-v] [-u <username>] <password>

  -v  Verbose output
  -u  Passwords based on username lowers pwquality score

If the password policy is not met an error message is printed
and EXIT_FAILURE (1) is returned. Otherwise EXIT_SUCCESS (0)
is returned.


== Note ==

The default location of the libpwquality configuration file
is currently used; /etc/security/pwquality.conf

If needed another command line option (-c maybe) can be added to
specify the location of the pwquality.conf file.
